# Guest Lecture: Functional Programming Patterns/Techniques for Software Engineers

In this repository, you will find the materials (i.e., slides, source code from
live coding) from the guest lecture on **Functional Programming Patterns/Techniques
for Software Engineers** held by SKIP 27th of October, 2024.

## About the Guest Lecture  

During this guest lecture, we've explored common **functional programming**
techniques and patterns that software engineers can use to write more robust,
maintainable, and scalable code. Furthermore, the lecture's objective was to
further bridge the gap between the theoretical concepts of functional programming
and their practical applications in software engineering practices.

## Credits  

We extend our heartfelt thanks to our guest lecturer for sharing their
knowledge and resources with us; the provided materials are courtesy of:
